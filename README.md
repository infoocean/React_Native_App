This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project,
bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the environment setup 
Node Version - v18.18.0 and npm version 9.8.1

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till cloning the GitHub repository, before proceeding.


## Step 1: After completing the environment setup you can clone the GitHub repository
using the command git clone https://github.com/infoocean/React_Native_App.git  and run command npm i to install all dependencies.

## Step 2: Start the Metro Server
First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.
To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

## Step 3: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android
```bash
# using npm
npm run android

### For iOS
```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.
This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App
Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
